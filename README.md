OTT Viewer Drop-off & Retention Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes viewer drop-off and retention behavior in OTT platforms using episode-level data.
The objective is to identify key content, behavioral, and platform-level drivers of viewer churn and provide data-backed recommendations to improve retention without compromising creative quality.

This project was developed as part of Winter Consulting 2025.

🎯 Business Problem

OTT platforms experience significant early viewer drop-off, which negatively impacts:

Watch time

Viewer retention

Content ROI

Key questions addressed:

Why do viewers drop off?

Which episode features increase drop-off risk?

How does drop-off vary across platforms and genres?

What content or product changes can reduce drop-off?

📂 Dataset

Granularity: Episode-level

Total Episodes: ~30,000+

Total Shows: 480

Platforms: 28

Region: United States

Key Data Features

Content attributes: cognitive load, hook strength, dialogue density

Viewer behavior: pause intensity, skip intro

Performance metrics: drop-off rate, average watch percentage

Risk indicators: retention risk level

🛠 Tools & Technologies

SQL (MySQL): Data cleaning, aggregation, analysis

Power BI: Interactive dashboards & KPI visualization

PowerPoint: Executive storytelling and recommendations

📈 Key Metrics

Drop-off Rate

Average Watch Percentage

Pause Intensity

Retention Risk (Low / Medium / High)

🔍 Key Insights

High pause intensity is the strongest indicator of viewer drop-off (~55–60%)

High cognitive load significantly increases early drop-off (~45–50%)

Weak or delayed hooks lead to ~35–40% drop-off

Drop-off varies significantly across platforms (up to a 15–17 pp gap)

Nearly 31% of episodes fall into the high-risk retention segment

✅ Recommendations

Optimize early-episode design (Episode 1–3) to reduce cognitive overload

Strengthen opening hooks within the first few minutes

Use pause and skip-intro behavior as real-time disengagement signals

Apply platform-specific optimization strategies

Introduce contextual recaps and viewer guidance for complex content

📊 Deliverables

SQL analytical queries

Power BI dashboards

Executive presentation (7-slide deck + appendix)

🚀 Outcome

The analysis demonstrates that viewer retention can be significantly improved by addressing early-episode design and behavioral signals, without diluting creative storytelling.
